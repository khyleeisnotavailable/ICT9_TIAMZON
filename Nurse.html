<li style="color:#4f7942;"> Nurse anesthesiologists are advanced practice nurse who provides anesthesia and pain medication to patients before, during, and <br> after surgery or other medical procedure. 
<li style="color:#4f7942;"> We also monitor the patient's biological functions and coordinate their care with other medical professionals
<li style="color:#4f7942;"> We are not medical doctors! Nurse anesthetists should not be confused with anesthesiologists in that CRNAs are <u> not medical doctors, </u> <br> but instead are advanced practice nurses with graduate degrees.</p>
