<h1> <font face="Verdana">  Elon Musk Claims Apple has 'threatened to withhold' Twitter from its app store</h1>

<p align="left"> <font face="Tahoma"> <b> New York (CNN Business)— </b> Elon Musk on Monday claimed that Apple has “threatened” to pull Twitter from its iOS app store, a move that could be devastating to the company Musk just acquired for $44 billion. <br>
<br> <i> "Apple (AAPL) has also threatened to withhold Twitter from its App Store, but won't tell us why", </i>Musk said in one of several tweets Monday taking aim at Apple (AAPL) and its CEO for alleged moves that could undermine Twitter’s business. <br>
<br> In another tweet, Musk claimed that Apple has mostly stopped advertising on Twitter.  <i> “Do they hate free speech in America,” </i> he said, in an apparent reference to his oft-stated desire to bolster his idea of free speech on the platform. <i> “What’s going on here [Apple CEO Tim Cook]?” </i> Musk added in a follow-up tweet. He also <u> criticized </u> Apple’s size, <u> claimed </u> it engages in “censorship,” and <u> called out </u> the 30% transaction fee Apple charges large app developers to be listed in its app store. <br>
<br> In one tweet Monday, Musk asked his nearly 120 million followers if they know <i> “Apple puts a secret 30% tax on everything you buy through their App Store?” </i> In another tweet, he posted a picture of a highway exit: one lane headed toward <i> “pay 30%,” </i> the other pointed toward “go to war.” An old car labeled “Elon” skidded toward the latter. </h3><br>
